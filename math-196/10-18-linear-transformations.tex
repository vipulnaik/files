{\bf PLEASE DO {\em NOT} DISCUSS ANY QUESTIONS.}

The quiz covers basics related to linear transformations (notes titled
{\tt Linear transformations}, corresponding section in the book
Section 2.1). Explicitly, the quiz covers:

\begin{itemize}
\item Representation of a linear transformation using a matrix, and
  identifying the domain and co-domain in terms of the row and column
  counts of the matrix.
\item Relationship between injectivity, surjectivity, rank, row count,
  and column count.
\item Relationship between the entries of the matrix and the images of
  the standard basis vectors under the corresponding linear
  transformation.
\end{itemize}

The question are fairly easy if you understand the material. But it's
important that you be able to answer them, otherwise what we study
later will not make much sense.

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\em Do not discuss this!}: Which of the following correctly
  describes a $m \times n$ matrix?

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item There are $m$ rows, and each row gives a vector with $m$
    coordinates. There are $n$ columns, and each column gives a vector
    with $n$ coordinates.
  \item There are $m$ rows, and each row gives a vector with $n$
    coordinates. There are $n$ columns, and each column gives a vector
    with $m$ coordinates.
  \item There are $n$ rows, and each row gives a vector with $m$
    coordinates. There are $m$ columns, and each column gives a vector
    with $n$ coordinates.
  \item There are $n$ rows, and each row gives a vector with $n$
    coordinates. There are $m$ columns, and each column gives a vector
    with $m$ coordinates.
  \end{enumerate}

\item {\em Do not discuss this!}: For a $p \times q$ matrix $A$, we can
  define a linear transformation $T_A$ by $T_A(\vec{x}) :=
  A\vec{x}$. What type of linear transformation is $T_A$?

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item $T_A$ is a linear transformation from $\R^p$ to $\R^q$
  \item $T_A$ is a linear trnasformation from $\R^q$ to $\R^p$
  \item $T_A$ is a linear transformation from $\R^{\max\{p,q \}}$ to $\R^{\min\{p,q\}}$
  \item $T_A$ is a linear transformation from $\R^{\min\{p,q\}}$ to $\R^{\max\{p,q\}}$
  \end{enumerate}

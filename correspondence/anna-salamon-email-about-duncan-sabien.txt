Hi Vipul,

I think a bit of https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_Center_for_Applied_Rationality is inaccurate, and figured I'd write you in case you care about that and want to correct it.  (Are you the right person to write to about this?  If not, do you know if someone else is?)

Specifically, the timeline currently reads (in part): "Sabien's departure is also linked to the Brent Dill controversy, as the CFAR leadership believed that he underestimated the risks posed by Brent Dill and gave him more access to the CFAR community.[64][65]"

In fact, Duncan Sabien had given notice to CFAR shortly before the mittenscautious medium posts about Brent came out, for unrelated reasons (though he was working with CFAR part-time still), and his later and fuller departure was on my best estimate (and on Duncan's and Tim's -- I checked after seeing your timeline) unrelated to the errors lots of us made around Brent Dill.

The reason I care about correcting this is: a lot of us at CFAR made serious mistakes in our dealings with Brent and CFAR.  I made serious mistakes in my dealings with Brent and CFAR.  So did Tim, our ED.  I feel bad about it.  Duncan was a staff member at the time, and did also make mistakes, but he did not do a disproportionate amount of the mistake-making, and I don't want to end up having him look like he held more of the responsibility for CFAR's errors than he did.  The CFAR apology post that you link to does not single out Duncan, and neither do the historical events, I think; and the current timeline passage makes it sound as though our apology post does single out Duncan.

Thanks for taking the time to read this; and hope you're well,
Anna
